# One Shot EG3d Projector
One-shot EG3D Projector ‚Äî unified e4e + EG3D + PTI pipeline for automatic single-image 3D reconstruction.

## üí° About
This project is **adapted from NVIDIA's [EG3D](https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d)** 
and further inspired by **[EG3D-projector](https://github.com/oneThousand1000/EG3D-projector)**.  
The goal of **One-Shot EG3D Projector** is to provide a **simplified, ready-to-use interface** 
for single-image 3D reconstruction.  

Unlike the original implementation that requires manual `.npy` preparation or multiple configuration steps,  
this version allows users to simply place **one input photo** in a designated folder and run a **single command** 
to perform the entire pipeline ‚Äî face alignment, latent inversion (e4e), EG3D rendering, and PTI fine-tuning ‚Äî 
all in one shot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Follows [EG3D requirements](https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements).

* 1&ndash;8 high-end NVIDIA GPUs. We have done all testing and development using V100, RTX3090, and A100 GPUs.
* 64-bit Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.11.0 (or later). See https://pytorch.org for PyTorch install instructions.
* CUDA toolkit 11.3 or later.  (Why is a separate CUDA toolkit installation required?  We use the custom CUDA extensions from the StyleGAN3 repo. Please see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#why-is-cuda-toolkit-installation-necessary)).
